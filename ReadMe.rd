Dependencies:

1. TypeScript is a language for application-scale JavaScript. TypeScript adds optional 
types to JavaScript that support tools for large-scale JavaScript applications for any 
browser, for any host, on any OS. TypeScript compiles to readable, standards-based JavaScript.

2. ts-node is a TypeScript execution engine and REPL for Node.js.
It JIT transforms TypeScript into JavaScript, enabling you to directly execute 
TypeScript on Node.js without precompiling. This is accomplished by hooking node's 
module loading APIs, enabling it to be used seamlessly alongside other Node.js tools 
and libraries.

3. @types/node - This package contains type definitions for Node.js (https://nodejs.org/).

4. Mocha - ☕️ Simple, flexible, fun JavaScript test framework for Node.js & The Browser ☕️

5. @types/mocha - This package contains type definitions for mocha (https://mochajs.org).

6. axios - Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js.

7. playwright - Playwright is a framework for Web Testing and Automation. 
It allows testing Chromium, Firefox and WebKit with a single API. 
Playwright is built to enable cross-browser web automation that is ever-green, 
capable, reliable and fast.
